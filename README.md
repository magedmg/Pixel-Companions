# Pixel Companion

“Pixel Companions” is a virtual pet simulator, allowing users to care for their chosen pet’s needs, such as giving it food and water, petting it, and cleaning up after it. Depending on the pet chosen, the difficulty and attributes will be changed accordingly, and users will be challenged to keep their pet alive until their pet reaches the required level. The project aims to be a way for users to enjoy their time with their pixelated friend, with the cute visuals and the challenge of micro-management motivating them to keep their pet alive for the required time. This game can be enjoyed by people of all ages who care for animals or simply want to be challenged and achieve the highest score they can, allowing users to escape the responsibilities of the real world or own a pet without the real-life commitment required.
